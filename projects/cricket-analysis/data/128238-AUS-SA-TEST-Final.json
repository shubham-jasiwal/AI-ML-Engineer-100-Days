The trophy drought has ended for South Africa. Emotions and tears of happiness run down the faces of all the South African players in the gallery.\u00a0A full toss, outside off, angled across, Kyle Verreynne\u00a0drives this through the cover region and has his bat and arms aloft as the ball travels to the ropes. The celebrations begin from Johannesburg to Cape Town, from Pretoria to Paarl, as they believed, and didn't stop dreaming that this day would arrive one day. And\u00a0their belief and patience have finally fruited after a long, long wait as South Africa win\u00a0the World Test Championship 2023-25, defeating Australia by 5 wickets.",

Travis Head\u00a0throws himself with the dive, with both his hands towards the direction of the ball. Falls over but maintains the ball in his hands.

Aiden Markram\u00a0gets on the front foot and flicks this neatly through mid-wicket for a cracking boundary.

Cummins did get Starc back on for a wicket but this is certainly not one of his wicket-taking deliveries. Not quite sure how are batters affected by delays but this is one of those occasions. There was a long gap between the third and fourth deliveries as Mulder was getting the sightscreen adjusted with Starc changing his angle to round the wicket. Maybe, that little break affected his concentration. A genuine half volley, outside off, Mulder leans and looks to drive on the up. Now, the only justification for Mulder, for not keeping that down could be that the ball came really slow off the surface. Hence, he was not in total control and ended up chipping it straight to Marnus Labuschagne\u00a0at cover. Mulder just stands there in disappointment, or more in shock. The ball was there to drive, the shot was played, but it was about playing a second early or late. It is not his mistake when you look at the replays but when you look at it live, it is a very soft dismissal. The 61-run stand is broken and Mulder trudges off for 27.

Just like Labuschagne has been dismissed in similar fashions over the past two years, this is another of a typical way to get rid of Smith. Trap him in front of the stumps and hope that he misses the ball. When he does, it is pure gold. Stuart Broad would have been proud of that. Ngidi comes a bit wider from over the wicket and lands this on a length, outside off and makes it to nip back in. Smith, trying to work the ball to the leg side, gets across, but misses the ball. Is hit on the pads and Ngidi immediately goes up in an appeal. Surprisingly, Chris Gaffaney shakes his head and an excited Temba Bavuma\u00a0immediately asks multiple opinions regarding the review. No bat, say everyone. Height is fine, say everyone. He signals the 'T' and it returns three reds on Ball Tracking!

But it seems to have got stuck and Bedingham himself removes the ball and drops it onto the ground. Now, it sparks a small debate as Bedingham could have actually waited for a while before doing so, or rather just allowed Carey to do the needful. Because he pushed the ball pretty quickly, Carey and Khawaja appealed for handling the ball. The umpires got together with a smile and then ruled it not out.

Since Drinks, Bavuma had faced only 4 balls prior to this one, in the 25 bowled and he might have got frustrated.\u00a0Pat Cummins\u00a0hurls it on a fullish length, keeping the line of attack around off. It lands and then nips slightly away from the batter, with possibly some bounce on it as well. Temba Bavuma\u00a0weighs on the front foot to crack the cover drive, but unfortunately for him, he fails to hit it along the ground and ends up chipping it flat and to the right of cover. Marnus Labuschagne, with sharp eyes and hands, dives to his right and snaffles a superb catch.

Carey was already through his shot and played under the ball, with the cherry going on top of the ball to hit the stumps. Maharaj lets out a roar as he gets his 199TH SCALP in Test cricket!

What it does do is, pop the ball over Jansen's head, completing the parabola to his right. Jansen tries again, this time with his right hand. But it still does not stick.

For some reason, Labuschagne decides that he should be playing at this one, which is very wide from him. Could have been left alone and possibly, that's what he also thinks, but very late. He pushes and then decides to withdraw his bat, but water had flown under the bridge by then. Maybe, he expected the ball to move back in. But it didn't and all he managed was a thin outside edge to the keeper. Easy catch for Kyle Verreynne.
