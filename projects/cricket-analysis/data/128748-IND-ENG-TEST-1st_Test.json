And this has been some wonderfully carved ton from the left-hander. Sunil Gavaskar, from the stands, gestures towards him to perform the somersault, but Pant keeps it for later. This is pitched outside off, on a length, turning away off the pitch. Rishabh Pant\u00a0reaches after it and cuts it along the ground in the backward point region for a single. Gets to the other end, has his arms and bat aloft in the air. Gets a huge round of applause from the Headingley crowd and his partner, KL Rahul\u00a0walks up to him and gives him a warm hug. Twin centuries for Pant in this Test and he becomes the first Indian batter to score hundreds in both innings of a Test in England. Lived a bit dangerously at first, but once settled, he hasn't looked back at all. But this century of his has come at a very crucial juncture under challenging conditions.",

Brydon Carse\u00a0looks certain that he has got his man, but the skipper Ben Stokes is a bit reluctant and gestures that he heard two noises, but eventually opts for a review. Coming to the delivery, Carse bowls this full and angling into the line of the stumps, from around the wickets. Rishabh Pant\u00a0premeditates the shot, gets across and attempts to scoop it over short fine leg, but does not quite get the connection,\u00a0and loses his balance completely before falling\u00a0over on the pitch. Now, the question is whether the ball brushed off his bat. And yes, the UltraEdge does show a spike when the ball is next to the inside edge. It then thuds on the pad. Not Out and Pant stays, living a bit dangerously out there.",

Karun Nair\u00a0goes hard on the drive through the covers and does not bother to keep it down. It seems like he has got enough elevation but Pope at short cover flies for the heavens and plucks it with his right hand, going backwards to his left, out of thin air!
