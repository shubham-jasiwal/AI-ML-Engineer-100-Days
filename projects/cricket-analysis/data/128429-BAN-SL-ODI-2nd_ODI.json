In Powerplay 2, the fielding captain is allowed to keep four fielders outside the 30-yard circle. But Mehidy chose to keep only three, making singles difficult for the batters to attain and the temptation of going over the top dangling. And the entire bowling unit has done well in cutting off both, boundaries and runs. Both, Asalanka and Kamindu tried to veer away from that temptation of going over the top, but eventually, Asalanka's patience wears off. A short ball, around middle and leg, Charith Asalanka\u00a0looks to heave it over mid on but plays a bit too early. The ball hits the toe end of his bat and lobs tamely to mid on where Tanvir Islam\u00a0takes it calmly. Asalanka departs for 6 (17) and from 75/1, Sri Lanka\u00a0are now 99/4! Equation - 150 from 188.<br><b>Charith Asalanka (c) c T Islam b S Hossain 6 (17b 1x4 0x6)</b>",

    "content": "Huge appeal for LBW! Nothing from the umpire. Maheesh Theekshana\u00a0is literally pleading with the umpire but to the naked eye, that seemed to be going past the off stump. The Lankans have a chat and keeper Kusal Mendis\u00a0seems to be the most animated and eventually, convinces skipper Asalanka to take the review. It was a very full ball, around middle and off, and Parvez Hossain Emon\u00a0got low to sweep the ball on a knee, but missed it and was hit on the pads. UltraEdge does not detect anything when the ball is near the bat. As expected, Ball Tracking shows the ball to be going past the off stump.",
