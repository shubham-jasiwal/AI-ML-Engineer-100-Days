Ironic as it might seem, a pigeon has indeed got the breakthrough for Australia!\u00a0That break seems to have broken the momentum of Shamar Joseph\u00a0and the fastest fifty by a West Indian batter in Test cricket will stay with Shane Shillingford for a while. Flighted, outside off, Shamar looks to drive it through the off side, but gets a thick outside edge. It goes towards the keeper, but Alex Carey\u00a0cannot hang on. Luckily for him though, it hits his body and lobs up in the air. Since he is donning the helmet, Carey is not able to see where the ball went but Usman Khawaja\u00a0at first slip is aware of the situation. Charges forward and takes a very good catch. Australia\u00a0appeal but Shamar does not bother waiting. End of an entertaining 44 (22) and the 55-run stand is broken at last.

Justin Greaves\u00a0hits the drive on the up and to the left of mid off and sets off for the single. Alzarri Joseph\u00a0is a bit late to respond and Marnus just attacks the ball so well, and then goes at the correct end, towards the keeper and scores the direct end. Alzarri tries to slide his bat in but it is a lazy attempt. The throw hits the stumps and the Aussies are overjoyed while the umpire refers it upstairs. Sure enough, the first replay confirms that Alzarri is way short. So his lucky reprieve in Starc's previous over does not count for much and he departs for an 8-ball duck. One can understand Greaves' thought process. With around 10 minutes to go for Stumps, he wanted the tailender to face most of the balls, but unfortunately for him, it has cost his team a wicket.

With the game getting stalled after the wicket of Starc, Carey was not quite able to control the game the way he wanted. The West Indies\u00a0tried to frustrate him, opting to use the tactic which MS Dhoni had used in Nagpur against Australia in the fourth Test in 2008, when he had set them a target of 382 in the fourth innings. The pitch was flat, so MS asked his bowlers to bowl wide outside off and kept a 7-2 off side field. The tactic worked and cross-batted shots resulted in a wicket. More or less the same here. This is thrown wide outside off, Carey tries to reach out and go inside out over cover, but is not quite to the pitch of the ball. Gets it off the toe end of the bat and miscues it high in the air. Jayden Seales\u00a0comes across to his left from deep cover and takes a decent catch. So Chase strikes on his very third ball but what a knock it has been from Carey - a critical 65 (75).

There is a\u00a0loud appeal for caught behind but Nitin Menon says 'NO.' The Windies players seem confident, Justin Greaves\u00a0in particular and Roston Chase\u00a0does review it. The third umpire is called into question once again. UltraEdge shows a clear spike off the inside edge and the on-field decision is overturned. The 41-run stand is broken and it also brings the end of a fine knock of 63 (120) from Webster and Australia\u00a0are now 208/6, leading by 198 runs.<br><b>Beau Webster c S Hope b S Joseph 63 (120b 8x4 0x6)</b>",

Green was half forward to defend and got hit on the back pad. Greaves was supremely confident that he had his man but captain Chase was not so sure as there was some deliberation over the involvement of bat. Eventually, just in the nick of time, he signalled for the review. Once again, Adrian Holdstock is in the thick of things. Once again, the inside edge is the first thing to be checked. There is a spike when the ball goes past the front pad, but at the same time, the bat is coming down from behind the bat pad. Holdstock is not sure as to why that first spike is generated and then, going further, it seems like the ball has hit the bat and the back pad at the same time. Holdstock asks for the camera angles to go back and forth and eventually, says that he is not sure whether the ball hit the front pad first or the bat or the back pad. Lets the onfield call stay as it is. Head coach Daren Sammy cannot believe it, with hands on his head. Ball Tracking shows it to be hitting leg stump!",

But Green instantly took the review and Ball Tracking returned the decision in his favour, projecting the ball to go over the stumps! Actually, the on-air commentators are not too surprised.

On a good length, outside off, Shai Hope\u00a0looks to defend but the ball pitches and then seams back in massively. Catches the inside edge and flies over the stumps. But the keeper, Alex Carey,\u00a0dives spectacularly to his left, like a goalkeeper and takes a phenomenal catch. Or so it seems. Hope starts to walk but umpire Richard Kettleborough wants to check whether the catch was taken cleanly. Third umpire Adrian Holdstock checks multiple replays and one angle seems to suggest that the ball was grounded. The crowd likes that replay but then, go silent as Holdstock believes that the ball has been lodged perfectly in the gloves of Carey. Not quite sure that is the case, as there was a lot of doubt in that. My guess is the benefit of doubt should have gone to the batter.

This is more or less of the same.\u00a0This is a length ball, that lands outside off and stays low,\u00a0seaming in. Roston Chase is perhaps undone by the lack of bounce and seam movement off the surface as he fails to bring his bat down in time. Cummins appeals and up goes the umpire's finger. Chase immediately takes the review, even before discussing with his partner. And the first replay shows why.

Almost a replica of the dismissal of Jos Buttler in the 2019\u00a0Ashes in England's second innings in Manchester, where he left one alone off a similar length from Josh Hazlewood and it cannoned back in. Pretty sure that former England great Geoffrey Boycott would not be too impressed by this, as in his opinion, a batter has got the willow to wield, not leave the ball alone. Cannot totally blame King here though, as he has trusted the pitch's bounce on this occasion. Hazlewood has landed this on a good length outside off and got it to nip back in a long way. King perhaps thought that the ball will go over the stumps but to his dismay, it has hit the off stump. King stands there in dismay and amazement. He eventually starts walking off, having made a compact 26 and his dropped chance on exactly the same score, in Hazlewood's previous over, does not count for much.

Inside edge seemed to be the main point of concern and the first replay indicates that there was a big inside edge. Early signs of desperation from the Aussies? On a length, outside off, Roston Chase\u00a0looked to defend but the ball nipped back in and hit him on the pads. There was a massive shout from Sam Konstas\u00a0at short leg but the umpire moved away. The ball deflected towards fine leg and the batters took a single. Hazlewood was not that interested but Cummins came in to discuss with his players and with 3 seconds left on the clock, signals for the review. UltraEdge confirms a big spike when the ball is near the bat but for some reason, Cummins looks bemused. That's because there are two angles shown - one straight on and one from the side angle. Now, the Aussies feel that the spike is when the ball hits the pad and not the bat, but the evidence is clear enough that the spike was off the bat. Review lost by the Aussies and really surprising to see their body language so frustrated early in the morning. Have to blame Sam Konstas for this review, because he was the closest to the batter and should have known whether there was wood involved or not.",

A length ball, wide outside off, Travis Head threw his bat at it but missed. There was a noise as the ball went past the bat and Shamar Joseph appealed for the caught behind. Initially, umpire Nitin Menon did not give it out. The bowler looked at his keeper, Shai Hope, who was not sure, while Justin Greaves at second slip seemed to indicate that the ball had bounced. Shamar looked at skipper Chase for support and he denied to take the review, citing that no one was sure. However, now comes some late drama. Suddenly Nitin Menon decides to check whether the ball has carried or not to the keeper and signals it towards the third umpire. The third umpire first checks for the nick, which is confirmed by UltraEdge. Now, comes the difficult part. Innumerable replays are shown and no one is sure for certain whether the ball landed directly in Hope's gloves or did it bounce in front. Head of course, is sure that it had bounced but the crowd seems to erupt on seeing the replay. For the fans, that has carried directly into the gloves. The Windies wait with bated breadth but it takes ever so long for Holdstock to take a decision. And rightly so. Because the ball dipped, it is very difficult to say whether the ball carried or not. Eventually, the third umpire says that he has got no conclusive evidence that the ball has carried, so Head remains not out!",

Greg Blewett was just mentioning on air, that West Indies\u00a0perhaps missed the trick post Lunch, not having Shamar Joseph\u00a0start after Lunch. Here he is, on the 10th ball of his new\u00a0spell, got Khawaja! So Nelson, supposed to be unlucky for England, proves to be unlucky for Australia,\u00a0as the 89-run stand is broken! This is what extra speed can do. A short ball, outside off, Usman Khawaja\u00a0goes for the pull, swivelling a touch but is perhaps a touch late in executing that shot. Maybe, he is beaten by the pace on that delivery. Gets an underedge, which is taken by the keeper, Shai Hope.\u00a0So, the doors shut down on Khawaja, who finally departs for 47, having been dropped twice - on 6 and 45.

As a result, he goes for the pull early while the ball arrives a second later. A top edge is induced and the ball swirls in the air near short square leg. The keeper, Shai Hope,\u00a0calls for the catch and moves swiftly to his left and takes a while to compose himself. The ball is still swirling in the air and he makes sure he watches the ball till the last moment and takes it nicely in front. Inglis departs for 5 and Australia\u00a0are 22/3!<br><b>Josh Inglis c S Hope b J Seales 5 (15b 0x4 0x6)</b>",
