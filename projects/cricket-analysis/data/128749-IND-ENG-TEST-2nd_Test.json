A picture-perfect start for the Indians as half of England's side is back in the dressing room on 84. A well-directed bumper from Siraj this, around the left shoulder\u00a0and kicking off the deck. Ben Stokes\u00a0is taken aback by that excessive lift off the deck and hangs his bat in an evasive action, but doesn't manage to drop his wrists down in time. Hence, a faint edge is found and the ball carries back to the keeper.\u00a0Rishabh Pant\u00a0takes a regulation catch and Ben Stokes\u00a0departs for a golden duck. Siraj gets his third wicket and his joy knows no bounds.<br><b>Ben Stokes (c) c R Pant b M Siraj 0 (1b 0x4 0x6)</b>",
