Pushed through from around the wicket by Taijul Islam, this keeps a bit low, on middle, Vincent Masekesa\u00a0gets back and stabs it out to the right of mid-wicket. He gets called through for a quick single by Blessing Muzarabani. Mominul Haque\u00a0gets to the ball quickly at mid-wicket and fires in a throw at the bowling end. He scores a direct hit and the third umpire is called into action. The replays show that Vincent had his bat on the line and no part of it was behind the crease when the stumps lit up. Bangladesh register a win by an innings and 106 runs!<br><b>Vincent Masekesa run out (Mominul Haque) 2 (15b 0x4 0x6)</b>",
