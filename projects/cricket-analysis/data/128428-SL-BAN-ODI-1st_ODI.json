    "content": "Tough outing for Mehidy Hasan Miraz\u00a0as skipper. One review lost due to Najmul Hossain Shanto\u00a0and the second one lost due to his keeper and bowler. Cannot blame the keeper here as he could not have seen wood from his angle.\u00a0This is on a good length and around middle, angling in sharply. Janith Liyanage\u00a0tried\u00a0to play at it from the crease, but his bat got\u00a0stuck behind the pads and the ball\u00a0hit him on the pads. Initially, it looked\u00a0like the ball hit\u00a0his pad first and Taskin is very sure of that. The keeper is more interested in the impact but Ahmed says that the batter was well in line of the stumps. After much deliberation, Mehidy takes the DRS. However, the replay and UltraEdge confirm that it is indeed bat first. Both reviews exhausted by Bangladesh!",

But this one was delivered with the arm and there was a bit of drift into the right hander, from around the wicket. Mendis looked to defend but missed and was hit on the pads.

UltraEdge detects nothing when ball is near the bat while Ball Tracking shows the ball to be clipping the outer half of leg stump, which returns an umpire's call.
