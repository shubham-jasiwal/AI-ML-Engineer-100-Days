Hits the ball flat and straight to the mid off fielder, where Zak Crawley crouches low to grab the catch to his right, but seemingly leans a bit too much to his right and loses his balance.

Ben Stokes is taken aback by that excessive lift off the deck and hangs his bat in an evasive action, but doesn't manage to drop his wrists down in time. Hence, a faint edge is found and the ball carries back to the keeper. Rishabh Pant takes a regulation catch and Ben Stokes departs for a golden duck.

Only manages to get an inside edge and Rishabh Pant does the rest behind the wickets. Dives to his left and completes a low catch. A big appeal for caught behind and the finger goes up!

830000000,128748,"Pitched up, in the channel and seaming away, Rahul makes another watchful leave.",Chris Woakes,KL Rahul,2,5
800000000,128748,"Hits the hard length and gets the ball to nip away a bit from outside off, Rahul leaves it alone.",Chris Woakes,KL Rahul,2,4
770000000,128748,"Good length, pretty straight at the stumps, Rahul plays it late and turns it towards mid-wicket.",Chris Woakes,KL Rahul,2,3
750000000,128748,"Fuller in length and on off, flicked away to mid-wicket.",Chris Woakes,KL Rahul,2,2
720000000,128748,"A huge, huge appeal for LBW but the umpire remains unmoved. Woakes, Ben Stokes and the keeper have a quick chat about the review and decide against it, probably sliding down leg. Coming to the delivery, Woakes bowls it a tad full on middle and gets the ball to nip back in. Rahul looks to clip it away but misses and gets hit on the pads. Replays later confirm that it would have missed the leg stump.",Chris Woakes,KL Rahul,2,1
700000000,128748,"Immediately around the wicket to the left-hander. Bowls it very full and on off stump, Jaiswal drills it back to the bowler.",Brydon Carse,Yashasvi Jaiswal,1,6
670000000,128748,"Length ball, speared in towards the pads, Rahul nudges it behind square leg and picks up an easy single to get off the mark.",Brydon Carse,KL Rahul,1,5
650000000,128748,"Full and outside off, a bit of wobble on that delivery as Rahul watchfully leaves it alone.",Brydon Carse,KL Rahul,1,4
620000000,128748,"Keeps the length relatively full and looks to angle it back in from around off, Rahul lunges across and blocks it to cover-point.",Brydon Carse,KL Rahul,1,3
580000000,128748,"Much better from Carse! This is pitched up on the off stump, KL Rahul presses forward and defends it into the off side, looking for a single but is quickly sent back.",Brydon Carse,KL Rahul,1,2
540000000,128748,"A bit of a loosener to begin with. Shorter in length and drifting down leg, KL Rahul looks to nudge it fine but misses.",Brydon Carse,KL Rahul,1,1
510000000,128748,"A bit of extra bounce now! Banged in on shortish length and bowled outside off, Yashasvi Jaiswal looks to hammer the cut and rises with the bounce but the ball sails over his willow.",Chris Woakes,Yashasvi Jaiswal,0,6
480000000,128748,"FOUR! India are up and running and so is Yashasvi Jaiswal. Hard length, drifting onto the leg stump, Jaiswal plays a neat leg glance and gets it very fine into the fine leg fence to open his account.",Chris Woakes,Yashasvi Jaiswal,0,5
450000000,128748,"The in-between length now, bowled wide outside off, looking to bring the ball back in. Jaiswal leaves as the ball just swings back in late.",Chris Woakes,Yashasvi Jaiswal,0,4
420000000,128748,"Drags the length back and brings the line towards middle and off, Jaiswal presses back and defends it down on the deck.",Chris Woakes,Yashasvi Jaiswal,0,3
380000000,128748,"Much fuller now, just around off, darting across a bit as well. Jaiswal leans halfway and then leaves it alone again.",Chris Woakes,Yashasvi Jaiswal,0,2
350000000,128748,"Seam-up from Woakes, hitting the good length and bowling it in the channel outside off. No signs of swing as Yashasvi Jaiswal leaves it alone.",Chris Woakes,Yashasvi Jaiswal,0,1
