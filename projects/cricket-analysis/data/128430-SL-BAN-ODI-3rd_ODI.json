He seemed to be gone for all money as the keeper had enough time to collect the ball. Now, here came the drama. The batter was comfortably out of the ground as the bails were dislodged but the ball was not in Mendis' gloves. He was not sure and the umpire at point referred it upstairs. The replay shows that the stumping is affected cleanly but then, the lack of control of the ball creates doubts. The umpire keeps checking for replays and eventually, comes to the conclusion that the glove did disrupt the bails but the ball was in contact just about then, before falling over.

The ball spun away and hit him on the back pad. A confident Hasaranga appealed for LBW, running in excitement but in that motion, did something to his hamstring. He started to limp and Sri Lanka's immediate concern was their star player, as the umpire kept silent on the appeal. Eventually, with 5 seconds left on the clock, Asalanka signalled for the review, with the only discussion being the pitching and the point of impact. But here comes the suspense killer.

Remember a game in the earlier years, where Shane Watson was facing a bowler, I think Andre Russell, but Russell pulled out of the delivery stride midway. But then, he suddenly got full steam towards the umpire and Watto was dumbstruck. And got out as well.
