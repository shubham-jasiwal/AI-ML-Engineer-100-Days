3,"Pitched way outside leg, and much slower through the air. It lands and spins sharply into the batter to hit the splice of the bat as Bashir leans ahead to defend."
6,"Just over the stumps! Turning away, landing around leg. Bashir backs away to defend. Spins past the bat and goes over the off stump."
7,Spots Carse backing away and Akash bowls it well away from the batter's reach on the off side. Brydon Carse cannot reach and lets it go.
9,"NO BALL AND FOUR! On a nagging length, outside off, Brydon Carse swings for the hills as he looks to park it down the ground. Gets an outside edge that flies over the slip cordon for a boundary. Deep has overstepped."
17,"Lobbed to first slip and taken! Given out but successfully overturned by Shoaib Bashir. Pushed through from around the wicket, landing outside the line of the leg stump, Shoaib Bashir gets inside the line for the scoop. The ball sneaks past the bat and lobs off the pad towards first slip where KL Rahul takes it. The finger is raised but Bashir takes the review straight away. The UltraEdge shows no bat and the decision is overturned."
29,"Around the stumps, slowish delivery on a length. Slides on middle with some bounce and Josh negotiates well to dab it on the pitch."
31,"Outside leg, turning away on a length. Carse hangs back and pads it away."
34,"Good-length delivery, on off, Josh Tongue blocks it on the bounce to Siraj who grabs it over his head."

41,"BEATEN! Lands on the leg stump, and it rips across the batter to beat the bat of Tongue."
51,"One more that bites off the rough, outside leg, and spins across the stumps. It beats the bat of Josh Tongue who goes back and across to deal with it and is rapped on the pad. A gentle appeal for LBW, but the umpire Chris Gaffaney denies with a smile on his face."
52,"That spun prodigiously! Lands it outside leg, giving the ball more air, and it spins across the batter and beats Josh on the outside edge."
55,"Lifts off the rough, outside leg, spinning away from the batter. Josh Tongue just about manages to fend it to the off side with soft hands."
60,"Length, on off, dabbed to wide gully."
62,"Drags the length back, outside leg. Tongue goes back and across to dab it down to the pitch."
65,"CHANCE, PUT DOWN! KL Rahul drops a sharp catch! Jadeja lands it on the rough outside leg again, and gets a good grip from there as the ball turns sharply across the batter. Brydon Carse plays at it and gets a thick outside edge, and goes to the left of KL Rahul. Rahul there is a bit late to react and is probably beaten by the pace at which the ball came at him. Drags his both hands towards the ball, but puts it down eventually. The ball rolls behind and they cross."
69,"BEAUTY! Just shapes into the batter, on a length, and straightens up a bit, on off. Josh Tongue is caught in the crease and plays away from the body to poke at it. Gets beaten on the outside edge by a whisker."

101,"A well-directed bumper at the badge of the helmet, Chris Woakes ducks under it."

112,"On middle and leg, on a length, Woakes is right behind it in defence."
123,"A bit of inward shape, on off, on a length, Woakes gets behind the line and pats it down the deck."
129,"From around the wicket, landing outside the line of the leg stump. Chris Woakes shoulders arms and lets the ball hit his pads. Half a shout for LBW but that certainly pitched outside leg."
130,"On off, on a nagging length, Woakes gets back to block."
131,"On middle, Woakes presses back to block."
138,"Around leg, kept out on the leg side."

184,"Sharp turn! This lands well outside the line of the leg stump and spins towards the batter, on a nagging length, on middle, Smith plays the line but the ball goes past the outside edge and clips the back pad before going to slip."
185,"Stays over the wicket for the right-hander and slows it down, on middle, Jamie Smith is watchful in defence."
195,"FOUR BYES! This keeps low and does not turn much, outside off, on a length, Stokes lunges to smother the spin. The ball beats him on the outside edge and goes through the legs of Rishabh Pant."
196,"On off, on a length, Ben Stokes gets right forward to block."
203,FOUR! Hit with real authority! Mohammed Siraj goes into the wicket again but fails to get it high enough this time. On off and this sits up to be hit. Ben Stokes stands tall and hammers it through mid-wicket for a boundary. The 50-run partnership is up between Stokes and Smith.
204,Wide! A well-directed bumper around the left shoulder by Siraj. Ben Stokes sways away. Wide called for height.
212,"Now then! A chance created by Jadeja. Spin and bounce. Tough little period for Stokes! Landed around off, and turns across the batter on the leg stump. Ben Stokes hangs deep in the crease, and looks to work it across but gets it off the gloves and the ball dips in front of the leg gully fielder, where Gill, who is a bit deep, dives forward, and scoops it on the bounce."
213,"Turns in from the rough, on a length, on off. Ben Stokes goes back in the crease and blocks."

228,"Tighter line, on the off stump, on a length, Ben plays it back to Siraj with a straight bat."

234,"Turn and bounce! From over the wicket to the left-hander, this lands on the footmark outside the off stump and a puff of dust comes up. Stokes stays back and fends it down on the leg side."
244,"On middle, length-delivery. Smith taps it to the leg side."
261,"This stays a tad low! On a length, on middle and going across. Ben Stokes misses again to work that across and is beaten by the lack of bounce this time. The ball thuds on the pad and rolls to the gully region."
264,"Length, outside off, left alone."
265,"Nagging length, outside off, Stokes shoulders arms at it."
274,"Nagging length, around fourth and fifth stump. Stokes lets it be."

297,"OUT! PLAYED ON! BOWLED! Ollie Pope will feel a bit unlucky here, but India get the breakthrough! That extra bounce does the trick for Akash. He continues to hit the deck hard, on top of the middle. It lifts off the deck and surprises Pope who brings his bat in front to defend. But the ball nips in, grazes the back arm of the batter and rolls back into the stumps behind. Akash Deep is ecstatic as he gets his third wicket, and so are India. England are 80/4.<br><b>Ollie Pope b A Deep 24 (50b 3x4 0x6)</b>"
301,"Whoa! That just took off, but adjusted well by Brook! Hard length, lifting off the deck suddenly, on off, Harry Brook is flummoxed with the extra bounce but takes the bottom hand off the bat to dab it down. Gets it off the outside edge and the ball goes past the right of the gully fielder for a couple of runs."
303,"Nagging length, on middle, Harry defends it solidly."
305,"Hard length, on top of off, Harry Brook blocks it back to the bowler."
308,"On off, on a length, Brook lets it arrive and dabs it with soft hands to the off side."

330,"Nagging length, on middle and leg, steered to mid-wicket."

340,"That hurried him! A sharp nip-backer from off, on a length. Ollie Pope is rushed into the shot and is cramped up for space. Wears it on the thigh pad and the ball rolls behind."

378,"Keeps the line of attack outside off, on a length. Pope offers no shot as the ball nibbles away."
381,"Shapes in around off and then straightens off the deck, on a length. Root watchfully leaves by shouldering arms at it."
389,"FOUR MORE! Two in two for Duckett! And that's deliberately played! Around the stumps, length, around off. Ben Duckett opens the bat face and steers it between the third slip and the gully fielders. Nitish Kumar Reddy at gully is a bit late to react as he gets low, sticks out his right hand. Goes one-handed to grab the ball, but it evades him and races behind to the deep third fence."
391,"Pitches on middle and nibbles away, Ben opens the bat face late and glides it to gully."
407,"Ouch! On a nagging length, on off, Zak Crawley looks to get behind the line of the ball. Gets beaten on the inside edge as the ball jags back in and kicks up a bit to catch him on the box. Crawley is down on his haunches. Deep starts with a maiden!"

427,"Shortish delivery, spinning from outside leg, Ravindra Jadeja hangs back and punches it wide of mid-wicket for a single."

431,"Down leg, on a length. Jadeja lets it be."
433,"NO BALL for overstepping! Well down leg, Shubman Gill lets it be. Jamie Smith fails to gather it and concedes a bye."

445,"Turning away from the rough, outside off, Ravindra Jadeja shoulders arms."
450,"Sprayed down leg, Ravindra Jadeja makes the leave. Jadeja thinks it should have been a wide for bowling a negative line but the umpire does not think so."
451,"Leg bye! Tossed up, turning into the right-hander, outside off, Gill shuffles across for the reverse but fails to lay any bat on it. A leg bye is taken as the ball goes off the pads on the leg side."

538,"Drags the length back, on off, Jadeja gets on the back foot and nudges it to the left of deep mid-wicket for a couple of runs. Gill had to hurry there for the second run."

809,"On middle and leg, kept out on the leg side by KR."
814,"Oh, that could have gone anywhere! The umpire signals for the physio to come out. Did that go off the helmet? Or the glove? Looked to be the glove in real-time. This jags back in and the bumper does not rise as much as Karun expected it to. Nair tries to sway away from the line of the ball but fails to get down enough in time.

833,"Woakes goes into the wicket and gets a bit of away movement off the deck, around off, Karun presents a straight bat and keeps it out."

Gets an outside edge that goes along the ground past gully for a boundary. Yashasvi brings up 2000 runs in Test cricket.

909,"Angled in, on a hard length, around the hips, Rahul presses back and nudges it through square leg for a single to get off the mark."
915,"A vicious delivery and Bashir is struck right on the helmet! Mohammed Siraj shows serious concern as he walks up to Bashir to check if he's okay. A lethal bumper from Siraj, on the bodyline with some extra bounce. Shoaib Bashir is caught on the crease with the evasive action, but gets no time whatsoever to sway away from the line. The ball plonks straight onto the helmet and drops on the pitch. Bashir looks to be a bit shaken by that and the physio will be out for the concussion test."
918,"WIDE! Well outside the tramline on the off side, Jamie Smith lets it be and Pant dives low to his right to collect the ball. Wide called."

940,"Hits the deck hard, does Siraj, on top of middle. Jamie Smith watchfully punches it back to the bowler. Siraj collects the ball on the bounce and gives a bit of stare to Smith."
952,"Angles it into the middle and leg, Jamie Smith pushes at it but gets an inside edge and the ball travels to deep backward square leg for a single. With this, England have avoided the follow-on as the deficit shrinks below 200!"
953,"Attacks the middle stump, on a length, Jamie Smith gets on the back foot and punches it solidly on the pitch."
961,"Nagging length, around off, knocked out to the off side."

997,A huge cheer in the Hollies Stand as that's just missed by a whisker! Washington Sundar bowls across the batter and tosses it up on middle. Harry Brook again goes for the reverse but plays all over it and is clipped on the front pad. A huge appeal for LBW and Shubman Gill eventually takes the review. Nothing on UltraEdge and the Ball Tracking shows the ball to be sliding across the off stump. NOT OUT!

1336,"OUT! CAUGHT BEHIND! Mohammed Siraj does it again as he removes the English skipper on his very first ball. A picture-perfect start for the Indians as half of England's side is back in the dressing room on 84. A well-directed bumper from Siraj this, around the left shoulder and kicking off the deck. Ben Stokes is taken aback by that excessive lift off the deck and hangs his bat in an evasive action, but doesn't manage to drop his wrists down in time. Hence, a faint edge is found and the ball carries back to the keeper. Rishabh Pant takes a regulation catch and Ben Stokes departs for a golden duck. Siraj gets his third wicket and his joy knows no bounds.<br><b>Ben Stokes (c) c R Pant b M Siraj 0 (1b 0x4 0x6)</b>"

1391,"A PEARLER! Quite casual there from Brook! Akash hits the deck hard, and keeps it just outside off. Gets a good bit of bounce as the ball nips in a touch. Harry Brook stays back and lazily pokes at it, playing away from his body, and is beaten past the outside edge."

Akash comes back to over the wicket for the right-hander and serves the ball right up on the off stump, forcing the batter to play at it. Pope makes the mistake of playing across the line and the ball just nips away off the deck and squares him up. The outside edge is found yet again and the ball goes quickly towards second slip. KL Rahul reacts well to his right but fails to pouch it on the first attempt. KL manages to keep his composure and snaffles it on the second attempt. England have been rocked early, 13 for 2 now as the other centurion from the previous match, Ollie Pope, departs for a golden duck.<br><b>Ollie Pope c K Rahul b A Deep 0 (1b 0x4 0x6)</b>"
1457,"OUT! CAUGHT! Back onto the field and straight into the thick of things, is Shubman Gill and what a catch that is! Fine delivery from Akash Deep as he holds the length around the top of the stumps and bowls it in the corridor of uncertainty, gets this one to nip off the deck as well. Ben Duckett hangs back and looks to push at it but the away movement means the outside edge is found and it goes wide of third slip where Gill springs down to his left and takes a stunning catch with both hands. The centurion from the last match departs for a duck and England are 13/1!<br><b>Ben Duckett c S Gill b A Deep 0 (5b 0x4 0x6)</b>"

1468,Akash immediately goes around the wicket to the left-hander and hones in on the off stump line. Ben Duckett watchfully defends.
1471,"No ball! Better line now, on off and middle and Crawley blocks it off. However, Akash has overstepped and it will be a No Ball."
1473,"FOUR! A gorgeous stroke to get going from Zak Crawley. Pitches up around off, looking for some swing but the ball slides right on. Crawley leans on and plays it straight back past the bowler for a boundary to get off the mark."
1475,"OUT! STUMPED! Smartly done by Shoaib Bashir and India's long first innings comes to an end! Mohammed Siraj is early to step out of his crease and Bashir sees him coming. Bashir brings out the carrom ball and bowls it into the pitch, darting it down leg. Siraj ends up walking past the ball and Jamie Smith has all the time in the world to dislodge the bails.

1477,"Floated up on the stumps, Krishna blocks it off."
1478,"Half an appeal for LBW but nothing doing says the umpire. Flighted, but on a dragged length and drifted into the batter. Prasidh Krishna looks to defend but is beaten on the inside edge and gets hit on the pads."

1550,"OUT! TIMBER! What a delivery and that's come out of nowhere! Joe Root continues from around the stumps to the left-hander and gives it a real rip, tossing it up around middle. The ball seems to drift in and Washington Sundar just looks to defend down the line but the ball lands and turns sharply away from the left-hander, leaving Sundar baffled and goes on to crash into the stumps. Root is absolutely pumped as Sundar departs for a gritty 42 (103), ending a stand of 144 runs for the 7th wicket.<br><b>Washington Sundar b J Root 42 (103b 3x4 1x6)</b>"

1586,"EDGED AND FOUR! Shubman Gill won't mind that and he brings up a stellar 250, even surpassing the great Sachin Tendulkar's highest score of 248 and goes 9th on the list of top scores by an Indian batter in Test matches. Nagging length and around off, Gill pokes at it and just a hint of away movement is enough to induce the outside edge and the ball rolls away into the deep third fence."

1650,"Flighted up on the pads, nudged away around the corner on the leg side for a single."
