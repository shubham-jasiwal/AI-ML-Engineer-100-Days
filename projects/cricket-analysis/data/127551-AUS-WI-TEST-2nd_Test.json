Seales once again tempts the batter with a fuller delivery, outside off, shaping away too. Cameron Green\u00a0obliges and goes chasing after it. He throws his bat at it without any footwork and gets a thick outside edge. Roston Chase\u00a0at gully shows good reflexes and takes a sharp catch near his chest. Green walks back for 26 off 37, and Australia\u00a0are 93/4 now! THAT WILL ALSO BE LUNCH ON DAY 1!<br><b>Cameron Green c R Chase b J Seales 26 (37b 4x4 0x6)</b>",
